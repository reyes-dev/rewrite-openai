# Rewrite with ChatGPT
An application interface for interacting with the OpenAI API to achieve various results with user inputs. The purpose of this application is for me to practice using the OpenAI API
in creative ways, leveraging the Ruby on Rails framework to save and explore results and delivering the user interface with a React/TypeScript frontend.

# Features
I'm experimenting with adding different features to this application as I come up with them.
